# AI Usage Disclosure

**Please include this with your submission.**

## What is Appropriate AI Use? ✅

We encourage you to use AI tools for:
- **Explanations**: "What is one-hot encoding?" or "Explain data leakage"
- **Debugging**: "Why doesn't this code work?" + error message
- **Syntax help**: "How do I use pd.get_dummies()?"
- **Learning resources**: "Recommend a tutorial on standardization"
- **General concepts**: "What's the difference between mean and median?"

## What is NOT Appropriate? ❌

Do NOT:
- Ask AI to write your entire function for you
- Copy code from AI without understanding it
- Submit code without testing/modifying it
- Hide the fact that you used AI
- Use AI to do the assignment for you

## Your Disclosure

**Did you use any AI tools to help with this assignment?**

 Yes     

**If yes, please tell us:**

1. **What tools did you use?** (e.g., ChatGPT, Claude, GitHub Copilot)
   
   ChatGPT

2. **What specific things did you ask them to do?** (Be specific)
   
   I used it to troubleshoot errors in the code by pasting error messages 
   
   to help pinpoint problem code.

3. **How much of your final code came from AI vs. your own work?** (e.g., "AI gave me the formula, I wrote the loop" or "AI helped me debug an error")
   
   AI helped debug errors but all code was written and modified by me.
   

4. **Can you explain your code?** (Can you walk through what each function does and why you wrote it that way?)

   Mostly, but I have some questions
   
**Additional comments:**

Questions are not from AI but more generally with the structure of the pre-existing code.

## Why This Matters

- **Honesty helps you**: Complete and honest disclosure is viewed positively
- **We care about learning**: If you used AI appropriately, that's fine
- **Understanding is key**: We need to know you actually learned the concepts
- **Dishonesty is serious**: Hiding AI usage or submitting others' work is academic misconduct

## Questions?

If you're unsure whether your AI usage was appropriate, **ask your instructor before submitting**. We'd rather help you understand the guidelines than penalize you later.
